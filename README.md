# Quantum Computing
A very simple implenetation of grover's algorithm and quantum error mitigation. This was made to examine whether QEM would be viable for reducing error for grover searches.

Attached is also a research report which I wrote for the project.

## About the project
This a project that I with IBM quantum during my final year of high school 2020, recieving the award for science extension.
