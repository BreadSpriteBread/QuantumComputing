# Quantum Computing
A implenetation of grover's algorithm and quantum error mitigation using Qiskit and IBM's quantum computing API. 

This was made to examine whether QEM would be viable for reducing error for grover searches.

Attached is also a research report which I wrote for the project.

## About the project
This a project that I with IBM quantum during my final year of high school 2020, recieving the award for science extension.
